Advent of Code 2023 in Golang

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles made by [Eric Wastl](was.tl).

I am using this as an opportunity to learn Go and develop my puzzle solving skills. Also, it's fun!

To run each day's script, you must first download the input from [https://adventofcode.com/2023/](https://adventof.com/2023), and then, from the day's directory, run:

```bash
go run . <input.txt>
```
